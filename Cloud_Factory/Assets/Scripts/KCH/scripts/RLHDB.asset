      I don't want to dance! They apologized for writing my name on the team without
      asking me. Since they didn't start practicing yet, they decided to choose the
      choreography that requires one less person. But they said they were worried
      I might feel left out, so they asked me to watch them practice, to see if anyone's
      dancing wrong. Thank you for encouraging me to say no!! I hope the seed I planted
      in the Weather Room is of help!! \n - Amy"

    ENG: "Hahaha! This is Tank. I came back from the reunion. That bully apologized
      to me. As he grew, he felt more and more guilty about how his actions hurt
      me. He's been thinking about it for a while, he said. He was worried I might
      be in pain just by looking at his face. He was worried writing a letter might
      not deliver how genuine he is properly. He was worried apologizing in front
      of everyone would make an atmosphere where I was forced to forgive. So he quietly
      waited at a table far away from me so I felt safe, and approached me at the
      end of the reunion. It'll take more time before I can fully heal, but now that
      the bully from the past doesn't exist anymore, I decided to forgive him. It's
      not like I'll keep in touch with him, however. I was able to go to the reunion
      thanks to this place. I hope the seed I planted secretly would be of help to
      you. I bid you farewell! \n - Tank"
